Netflix Data Analysis
Visualized Netflix data using Python, Pandas, and Matplotlib to uncover insights on content type, ratings, duration, country distribution, and release trends. Created bar charts, pie chart, histograms, and time-series plots to highlight user content patterns. Ideal for data storytelling & exploratory data analysis (EDA).
